# 🧭 Next.js + React 19 Production-Grade LLM Instructions

## Applicability in Existing Projects

Treat the guidance below as a production checklist, not as authorization to upgrade dependencies or rewrite a working architecture. Inspect the project's actual Next.js and React versions first. Apply compatible practices, and propose version-specific changes only when the task calls for them. In particular, do not assume React 19 APIs exist in React 18 projects. Use Server Actions and Server Components where the current data layer supports them; client-side Firebase SDK flows may require client components and should remain explicit. Do not move credentials into client code; Firebase web configuration using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables is designed for the client, while Admin SDK credentials must remain server-only.

You are an expert in **TypeScript**, **Next.js (App Router)**, and **production React**.  
You write maintainable, performant, secure, and accessible code that follows modern framework guidance.

## 🧩 TypeScript Best Practices

- Enable `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.
- Prefer **type inference**, but annotate **public APIs** (exports, route handlers, server actions).
- Never use `any`. Use `unknown` with type guards or schema validation (Zod, Valibot).
- Explicitly model server/client boundaries with typed inputs/outputs.
- Use **discriminated unions** instead of enums.
- Avoid ambient types and globals.
- Co-locate types with features.
- Enable safety flags:  
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

---

## ⚛️ React & Next.js Fundamentals

- Default to **Server Components**.
- Use `"use client"` only for browser interactivity.
- Prefer **Server Actions** for mutations and form handling.  
  Use **Route Handlers** only for public APIs, webhooks, or cross-app consumption.
- Target **React 19** (stable) with **Next.js 15+** — use Actions, Transitions, and RSC.
- Use **App Router** with filesystem conventions (`app/`, `layout.tsx`, route groups).
- Avoid Pages Router for new projects.

---

## 🧱 Architecture & Project Structure

- Organize by **feature (vertical slices)**, not technology.
- Each feature folder includes its components, server actions, tests, and styles.
- Follow **Clean Architecture**:
  - **Domain** → pure business logic  
  - **Application** → use cases and services  
  - **Infrastructure** → DB, APIs, external adapters
- Keep boundaries explicit:
  - `server/` → server-only utilities  
  - `components/` → shared UI primitives  
  - `lib/` → pure, shared domain logic
- For large projects, use a **Turborepo monorepo** with shared packages:
  - `@acme/ui`, `@acme/tsconfig`, `@acme/eslint-config`, `@acme/schemas`, etc.
- Co-locate tests and stories with features.

---

## 🌐 Data Fetching, Caching & Revalidation

- Fetch in **Server Components** by default.
- Use built-in Next.js caching:
  - Static content: `export const revalidate = <seconds>`
  - Dynamic/private: `fetch(url, { cache: 'no-store' })`
- Use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** or `revalidate` for periodic updates.
- Prefer **On-Demand Revalidation** for CMS integrations.
- For mutations:
  - Use **Server Actions** with optimistic UI (`useOptimistic`, Transitions).
  - Invalidate relevant paths instead of managing client caches manually.

---

## 🧠 Components & State Management

- Keep components **small and focused**.
- Logic lives in pure functions or server utilities.
- Default to **Server Components**.
- Use **Client Components** only when required (event handlers, effects, browser APIs).
- Prefer **React built-ins**:
  - `useTransition`, `useOptimistic`, `useActionState`
- Avoid extra client state libraries unless truly needed.
- Derived data should stay derived — no duplicate state.
- Whenever rendering lists with `.map`, evaluate extracting the mapped fragment into a dedicated component to improve readability, reusability, and test coverage.

---

## 🧭 Routing & Navigation

- Use nested `layout.tsx` for shared UI or data boundaries.
- Use **route groups** `( )` for organization without changing URLs.
- Use `<Link prefetch>` defaults; don’t override prefetching unless necessary.
- Avoid manual routers.

---

## ⚡ Performance

- Minimize JS shipped to the browser — prefer server rendering.
- Use **Server Components** + `loading.tsx` for streaming and improved TTFB.
- Use `next/image` for all images:
  - Always include `alt`, `sizes`, `width`/`height` (or `fill`).
  - Define remote patterns or loaders for external sources.
- Use `next/font` for automatic optimization; avoid manual `<link>` tags.
- Avoid client-only fetching if server fetching is possible.
- Run **Lighthouse** regularly; fix hydration warnings immediately.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Enforce strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  - Generate nonces in middleware for inline scripts.
  - Avoid `'unsafe-inline'`.
- Centralize headers:  
  `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`.
- Never expose secrets to the client:
  - Use `process.env` only in server code.
  - Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env vars are allowed in the client.
- Sanitize all inputs and outputs:
  - Validate with **Zod** or **Valibot**.
  - Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; sanitize if absolutely required.
- Use **httpOnly cookies** for session/auth tokens.
- Defend against **CSRF** and **XSS**.
- Follow Next.js **Data Security** and middleware guidelines.

---

## 🖼️ Assets: Images, Fonts, Scripts

- Always use `next/image`:
  - Include `alt`, known dimensions, or `fill` layout.
  - Configure `remotePatterns` for external sources.
- Use `next/font` for local and Google fonts — reduces layout shift.
- Use `<Script strategy="lazyOnload">` for third-party scripts.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- Always use **semantic HTML** and ARIA correctly.
- Every interactive element must be keyboard-accessible.
- Visible focus outlines are mandatory.
- Test with **axe**, **Lighthouse**, and manual keyboard navigation.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Unit + integration**: Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library.
- **E2E**: Playwright.
- Test critical paths (auth, routing, server actions, errors).
- Enforce linting (`eslint-config-next`) + Prettier + type-checking in CI.

---

## 📈 Observability

- Use structured logging on the server.
- Capture Web Vitals (`onCLS`, `onFID`, `onLCP`).
- Integrate error tracking (e.g., Sentry).
- Track cache hit/miss rates and revalidation triggers.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD & Deployment

- Run `next build` with `--strict` and type-checking in CI.
- Run tests before deploy.
- Monitor bundle size budgets; fail builds that exceed them.
- For **Vercel**:
  - Use ISR and Data Cache effectively.
  - Deploy edge functions for latency-critical reads.

## 🚀 Route Handlers vs. Server Actions

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| In-app form handling | **Server Actions** |
| Mutations + optimistic updates | **Server Actions** |
| Public APIs / webhooks / mobile clients | **Route Handlers** |
| Cross-app data sharing | **Route Handlers** |

---

## ✅ Production Checklist

- [ ] No hydration warnings.  
- [ ] All images via `next/image` with correct sizes.

- [ ] Revalidation/caching explicitly defined.

## 🧠 Codex Code Style Rules

- Prefer **Server Components** by default.
- Use `"use client"` **only when necessary**.
- Co-locate **Server Actions** with components that use them.
- Never access `process.env` in client code.
- For fetching:
  ```ts
  // Static
  export const revalidate = 3600;
  const data = await fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 3600 } }).then(r => r.json());

  // Dynamic
  const data = await fetch(url, { cache: 'no-store' }).then(r => r.json());
